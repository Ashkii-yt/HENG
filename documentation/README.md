# Documentation — ENG / SENG / CENG 📝

This folder contains user-facing documentation for the ENG project (the `heng` language and two English-like DSLs: `seng` and `ceng`). It includes a concise usage guide, CLI examples, programmatic API notes, and tips for debugging and contributing.

Files:

- `USAGE.md` — How to install, run, and integrate compilers (recommended starting point).
- `README.md` — This file (overview and pointers).

💡 Quick start: open `USAGE.md` for step-by-step instructions and example commands.

If you'd like, I can also add a short CONTRIBUTING guide, API examples in `examples/`, or a LICENSE file — tell me which you prefer.
